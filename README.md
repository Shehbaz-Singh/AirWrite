# AirWrite ✍️  
**Character and Numerical Recognition Using OpenCV and Deep Learning**

## 🔍 Abstract

Recent advancements in image processing and pattern recognition have enabled the development of air-writing systems that transform motion into meaningful text. **AirWrite** is a touchless input system that allows users to "write" characters and numbers in the air using just their index finger. Combining real-time hand tracking using **OpenCV** and classification via deep learning, AirWrite provides an efficient, accurate, and hygienic way to interact with digital devices.

This project is particularly useful in settings that demand touchless interactions — such as healthcare or public kiosks — and also provides a new level of accessibility for individuals with physical disabilities.

## 💡 Features

- Real-time hand and fingertip tracking
